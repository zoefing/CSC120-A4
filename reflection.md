- What are your initial impressions of how `Encapsulation` affects your programming?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

This assignment was considerably more intuitive to me than A3; A4 "worked." I can't exactly place why, but perhaps it was being able to see components of the code split into different files. This organization prevented an overwhelming block of code. Encapsulation heavily factored into this shift, and in my case, for the better. This tool made implementing one class in another seamless (for the most part).

In terms of advice, it made a huge difference to test my code in each class file manually. This method solved the issue of a (seemingly) untraceable error arising after the entire program was written out. And, as always, reach out with any questions you have, whether during office hours, TA hours, or on discord. Sometimes, if you stare at something for too long, it becomes hard to take a step back and look at the issue objectively.
